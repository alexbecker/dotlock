Fast and safe dependency management for Python applications.

Motivation
----------

The de-facto standard way to keep track of Python dependencies is with a ``requirements.txt`` file,
listing the required packages and specifying what versions of them can be used.
There are two strategies for specifying versions in a ``requirements.txt`` file:
adding only the top-level dependencies and constraints you know to be necessary,
or adding every recursive dependency and pinning them to specific versions you know work.
The first strategy makes installing dependencies non-repeatable.
The second makes upgrading difficult, and is hard to manage with standard python tools.

Dotlock enables you to do both: keep track of top-level requirements and known constraints
in ``package.json``, and generate repeatable requirement sets in ``package.lock.json``
by running a single command: ``dotlock lock``.

Dotlock is partly inspired by `pipenv <https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/>`_, which also provides
dependency-locking functionality. However, dotlock attempts to improve over ``pipenv`` in
the following ways:

* Accuracy: ``pipenv`` only locks to the level of versions, not specific distributions.
  This is why a ``Pipfile.lock`` will often contain multiple hashes for the same dependency,
  and means you do not know exactly what distribution will be installed when you run ``pipenv lock``.

* Speed: ``pipenv lock`` is very slow in my experience.

* Reliability: ``pipenv`` does a lot of stuff, but it also has a lot of bugs.

* Extras Support: ``pipenv`` only supports "default" dependencies and "dev" dependencies;
  ``dotlock`` supports arbitrary extra dependency groups, e.g. ``dotlock install --extras tests``.

Under the hood, ``pipenv`` is essentially a complicated wrapper for ``pip``, relying on it
for metadata discovery and extraction, dependency resolution, dependency downloading and installation.
To improve on ``pipenv``, ``dotlock`` handles most of these itself, relying on ``pip`` only to install
already-downloaded dependencies.

Installation
------------

Dotlock can be installed with ``pip``, i.e. ``pip install dotlock``.
It can be installed in an application's virtual environment, at the user level, or globally.

Development Setup
-----------------

On your development machine, run ``dotlock init`` to create a virtualenv and a skeleton ``package.lock`` file.
Add your sources and dependencies to ``package.lock``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "sources": [
            // PyPI-like package index hosting the dependencies.
            // If multiple indexes are included, each is tried in order during dependency resolution.
            "https://pypi.org/pypi"
        ],
        "default": {
            // Requirements in the form "package-name": "specifier".
            // Version specifiers may be "*", or a version number preceded by any of <, <=, >, >=, or ==.
            // Multiple specifiers can be separated by commas, e.g. ">=2.1,<3.0".
            "setuptools": ">=39.0",
            "virtualenv": "*",
            // Git, Mercurial and Subversion dependencies are also supported.
            "requests": "git+git://github.com/requests/requests@v2.19.1",
            // If you need extras or markers, supply a dictionary instead of a string.
            "idna_ssl": {
                "specifier": "*",
                "marker": "python_version < 3.7",  // See PEP 496
                "extras": ["tests"],
            },
            // Local file paths can be used too, but this loses integrity guarantees.
            "mypackage": "~/projects/mypackage"
        },
        "extras": {
            // You can specify groups of additional dependencies that will be installed by
            // dotlock install --extras [names]
            "dev": {
                "ipython": "*"
            },
            "tests": {
                "pytest": "*"
            }
        }
    }

Then you can lock and install your dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

    dotlock lock  # Creates package.lock.json.
    dotlock install  # Installs exactly the distributions in package.lock.json.
    # Either source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtualenv, or use dotlock run.
    dotlock run [program] [args]  # Runs [program] in the virtualenv.

For more information, run ``dotlock -h`` or ``dotlock [command] -h``.

Developing in Different Environments
------------------------------------

If your development environment differs significantly from your target deployed environment,
e.g. you use a different operating system or a different version of Python, you will have to
do some extra work and lose some of the benefits of ``dotlock``.

In order to resolve dependencies and select distributions correctly, ``dotlock`` needs to know
certain features of the deployed environment. Run ``dotlock dump-env`` on the deployed environment
to create an ``env.json`` file. This file should live alongside your ``package.json`` file, and
will be used by ``dotlock lock``.

Since ``package.lock.json`` contains only the distributions appropriate for your deployed environment,
running ``dotlock install`` on an incompatible environment will error. Instead, you can run
``dotlock install --skip-lock``, which will bypass ``package.lock.json``, looking just at ``package.json``.

Deployment
----------

There are two ways to install your locked dependencies during deployment:

* Install ``dotlock`` and run ``dotlock install`` in the application root directory.

* Use ``dotlock bundle`` to create ``bundle.tar.gz`` and ``install.sh`` prior to deployment,
  include these files in the deployment, and run ``./install.sh`` during deployment.

Using ``dotlock bundle`` is preferred because it does not require installing ``dotlock`` in
the deployed environment and does not depend on external services during deploy.

Once the dependencies are installed, run your application with one of:

* ``source venv/bin/activate; [program] [args]``

* Assuming ``dotlock`` is installed: ``dotlock run [program] [args]``

Roadmap and Limitations
-----------------------

Planned features:

* Interpolate environment variables in ``sources``

* Allow specifying indices for individual packages

* Allow updating individual packages with ``lock --update [package-names]``

Features under consideration:

* Support virtualenvs other than ``./venv``

* Support versions of Python before 3.6

* Support locking for other platforms. This is not possible to do with perfect reliability,
  since the dependencies discovered by running ``setup.py`` may differ depending on what
  platform the script is run on.
